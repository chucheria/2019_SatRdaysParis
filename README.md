# Football meets graphs

This repository is a small analysis about *home advantage* and *competitiveness* in football. It uses the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) database and its R API wrapper [Neo4r](https://github.com/neo4j-rstats/neo4r). 

The *neo4r* package is in experimental phase. That gives us some limits in use, that's why the script has data retrieval and data wrangle but I believe both analysis can be almost entirely done in *neo4j*.
